# APLI-IMC - Body Mass Index Calculator

This web application, developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI). BMI is a widely used measure to assess a person's nutritional status and potential weight-related health risks. It is calculated using an individual's weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters).

The application provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to input their weight and height. It then quickly computes the BMI and displays the result, along with a classification (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight, obesity) based on World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Understanding your BMI can be a first step towards achieving or maintaining a healthy weight.

## Features

-   **Simple Input:** Easy-to-use input fields for weight (in kilograms) and height (in centimeters or meters).
-   **BMI Calculation:** Accurate calculation of Body Mass Index.
-   **Result Classification:** Clear presentation of the calculated BMI value and its corresponding WHO classification (e.g., Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, Obesity).
-   **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to work on various screen sizes, including desktops and mobile devices (assuming this is true, standard for web apps).
-   **No Data Storage:** User data is processed in the browser and not stored, ensuring privacy.

## How to Use

1.  **Open the Application:** Launch the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2.  **Enter Your Weight:** Input your current weight in kilograms (kg) into the designated field.
3.  **Enter Your Height:** Input your height in centimeters (cm) or meters (m) into the designated field. *Ensure you use the correct unit as specified by the input field.*
4.  **Calculate BMI:** Click the "Calculate" or similar button.
5.  **View Results:** Your BMI will be displayed, along with its category (e.g., Underweight, Normal, Overweight).
